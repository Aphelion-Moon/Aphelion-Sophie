# Verification and release limits

The current source passed these checks on 27 September 2026:

- Repository validation: 442 JavaScript modules, 31 reference checksums, and eight
  asset copies; module conventions passed.
- Unit suite: 418 passed, zero failed or skipped.
- Isolated configuration suite: 13 passed, including host shutdown, interrupted
  application, permissions, and retained configuration.
- Isolated staging suite: 16 passed, including signed ingress, Gateway lifecycle,
  maintenance, public onboarding panels, and Staff closure.

Both isolated database clusters stopped after their tests. These results establish
offline behavior, not private Discord/browser acceptance or production readiness.
The source specifications describe expected behavior; they are not execution logs.

Runtime data and credentials are private and excluded from Git. Operational records,
generated tooling, and further test output belong in the operator's external
agent-documents directory, not the published repository.

Production recovery is deferred. Windows service identities, SCM startup/shutdown,
host reboot qualification, and remaining production release gates are open.
No private ticket, form, attachment, transcript, or onboarding content was inspected.
